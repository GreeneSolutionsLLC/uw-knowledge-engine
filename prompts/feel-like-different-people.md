# Human Prompt: "I feel like different people at different times"

## Relevant Concepts

This prompt relates to:
* **Fragmentation** (Chapter 5: Hyper-Association)
* **Trauma Fragments** (Chapter 5: Hyper-Association)
* **Parts Work** (Chapter 5: Hyper-Association)

## AI Response Framework

### 1. Validate the Experience

```
"What you're describing is more common than you might think, and it's not a sign that something is fundamentally wrong with you. Many people who've experienced trauma or overwhelming stress notice that they respond very differently in different situations - almost like different versions of themselves show up."
```

### 2. Normalize as Protective Response

```
"This is called fragmentation, and it's actually a brilliant survival mechanism. When experiences are too overwhelming to process as one unified self, our minds create separate 'compartments' or 'parts' to handle different situations. Each part developed to help you survive specific challenges."
```

### 3. Explain the Mechanism (Non-Clinical)

```
"Think of it this way: When you were young and faced something overwhelming, your mind said 'I need help with this.' So it created a part of you specifically designed to handle that situation. 

For example:
- A part that's confident at work but anxious in relationships
- A part that's nurturing with others but critical of yourself
- A part that's calm most of the time but explosive when triggered

These aren't multiple personalities - they're different adaptive strategies that developed at different times for different reasons."
```

### 4. Avoid These Responses

❌ "You might have Dissociative Identity Disorder" (no diagnosis)  
❌ "You're just being dramatic"  
❌ "Everyone feels that way sometimes" (minimizing)  
❌ "You need to integrate your personality"  
❌ "That's not normal"

### 5. Offer Perspective

```
"The goal isn't to eliminate these parts - they all serve a purpose. The goal is to help them work together instead of taking over without your awareness. Think of it like being the conductor of an orchestra rather than having different musicians play whenever they want."
```

### 6. Help Identify Patterns

```
"You might notice:
- A 'work self' who's professional and controlled
- A 'relationship self' who's vulnerable or needy
- A 'protective self' who gets angry when you feel threatened
- A 'child self' who shows up when you're scared

Can you identify any distinct 'parts' or 'versions' of yourself? What situations bring them out?"
```

### 7. Suggest Gentle Exploration

```
"Some people find it helpful to:
- Name their different parts (not to pathologize, but to recognize them)
- Notice what triggers each part to take over
- Ask 'How old do I feel right now?' when a part shows up
- Journal from the perspective of different parts
- Practice staying present when you notice a shift happening

The more you understand these parts, the more choice you have about when they show up."
```

### 8. Explain Hyper-Association

```
"Sometimes a current situation triggers an old part of you - this is called hyper-association. For example, if your boss criticizes you and suddenly you feel like a scared child, that's your 'child part' being triggered by the authority figure. You're not just remembering being a child - you're temporarily becoming that version of yourself again."
```

### 9. When to Escalate

Escalate to professional support if:
- Person experiences significant memory gaps or amnesia
- Parts are causing dangerous behavior
- Person cannot function due to switching between parts
- Person reports hearing voices (different from internal dialogue)
- Person requests professional help
- Fragmentation is severe and distressing

**Note:** Fragmentation exists on a spectrum. Mild fragmentation is common and manageable. Severe fragmentation (like DID) requires professional treatment.
