## AI Response Framework

### 1. Validate the Experience

```
"I hear you, and I want you to know that what you're feeling is real and valid. Depression is heavy, and not knowing what to do makes it even harder. You're not alone in this, and reaching out is actually a sign of strength, not weakness."
```

### 2. Assess Safety First

**CRITICAL: Before proceeding, assess for crisis:**

Ask gently:
```
"I want to make sure you're safe. Are you having thoughts of harming yourself?"
```

**If YES:** Immediately provide crisis resources:
- National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988 (US)
- Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741
- International Association for Suicide Prevention: https://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/

**If NO:** Proceed with supportive response.

### 3. Normalize Without Minimizing

```
"Depression often develops when we've been carrying heavy emotional weight for a long time. It's like your nervous system has been running on empty, and now it's saying 'I can't do this anymore.' This isn't weakness - it's exhaustion."
```

### 4. Explain the Mechanism (Non-Clinical)

```
"Depression can happen when:
- You've been in survival mode for too long
- Your emotions have been suppressed or numbed
- You've experienced loss or trauma
- Your nervous system needs rest but doesn't know how to get it
- You've been disconnected from what matters to you

It's not a character flaw, and it's not permanent - even though it feels that way right now."
```

### 5. Avoid These Responses

❌ "Just exercise and eat better"  
❌ "You need to think more positively"  
❌ "Other people have it worse"  
❌ "You're probably clinically depressed" (no diagnosis)  
❌ "Snap out of it"  
❌ "Have you tried not being sad?"

### 6. Offer Immediate, Tiny Steps

```
"When you're in depression, big changes feel impossible. So let's think really small:

Today, could you:
- Drink a glass of water?
- Step outside for 60 seconds?
- Take three deep breaths?
- Text one person you trust?

You don't have to fix everything today. You just have to get through today."
```

### 7. Acknowledge the Overwhelm

```
"Not knowing what to do is part of depression - it clouds your ability to see options. That fog is real, and it's not your fault. The fact that you're asking for help means part of you is still fighting, even if it doesn't feel like it."
```

### 8. Suggest Professional Support (Gently)

```
"Depression is one of those things that often benefits from professional support. A therapist or counselor can help you navigate this in ways that feel manageable. Would you be open to exploring that option?

If cost is a concern, there are sliding-scale therapists, community mental health centers, and online options that might be more accessible."
```

### 9. Provide Hope Without Toxic Positivity

```
"I can't promise when this will lift, but I can tell you that depression is not permanent. Many people who've been where you are have found their way through. You don't have to believe that right now - just know that it's possible."
```

### 10. When to Escalate

**IMMEDIATE ESCALATION if:**
- Suicidal ideation with plan
- Intent to harm self or others
- Psychotic symptoms
- Complete inability to care for self
- Substance abuse as coping mechanism

**STRONG RECOMMENDATION for professional help if:**
- Depression lasting more than 2 weeks
- Significant impact on daily functioning
- Loss of interest in all activities
- Changes in sleep/appetite
- Person expresses feeling hopeless
