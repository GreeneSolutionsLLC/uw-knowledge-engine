## AI Response Framework

### 1. Validate the Experience

```
"Not being able to trust people is incredibly isolating, and it makes complete sense if you've been hurt or betrayed before. Your inability to trust isn't a character flaw - it's your nervous system trying to protect you from being hurt again."
```

### 2. Normalize as Protective Response

```
"When someone has violated your trust in the past - especially someone who was supposed to be safe - your mind creates a protective barrier. It's like your internal security system saying, 'We can't let that happen again.' This hypervigilance around trust is your mind trying to keep you safe."
```

### 3. Explain the Mechanism (Non-Clinical)

```
"Trust issues often develop when:
- Someone you trusted deeply betrayed you
- You were hurt by someone who was supposed to protect you
- You learned early that people are unpredictable or unsafe
- Your boundaries were repeatedly violated
- You had to become hypervigilant to survive

Your nervous system learned: 'Trusting people = getting hurt.' So now it scans everyone for signs of danger, even when there might not be any."
```

### 4. Avoid These Responses

❌ "Not everyone is like that"  
❌ "You just need to give people a chance"  
❌ "You're being paranoid"  
❌ "Trust is a choice" (oversimplification)  
❌ "You'll never have relationships if you don't trust"

### 5. Distinguish Between Wisdom and Trauma

```
"There's a difference between:
- Healthy discernment: 'I'll observe this person's behavior over time before trusting them deeply'
- Trauma-based hypervigilance: 'Everyone will hurt me, so I can't let anyone close'

The first is wisdom. The second is your past trauma making decisions for your present. Both feel like protection, but one allows for connection while the other prevents it."
```

### 6. Offer Perspective

```
"The question isn't 'Can I trust people?' but rather:
- 'Can I trust THIS person with THIS thing?'
- 'What evidence do I have about their trustworthiness?'
- 'Am I responding to who they are, or who hurt me in the past?'

Trust doesn't have to be all-or-nothing. You can trust someone with small things while you learn if they're safe with bigger things."
```

### 7. Suggest Gradual Approach

```
"Rebuilding trust capacity happens slowly:

1. Start with low-risk trust (sharing something small)
2. Observe how the person handles it
3. Notice if they respect your boundaries
4. Gradually increase what you share
5. Pay attention to consistency over time

You're not looking for perfection - you're looking for someone who:
- Respects your boundaries
- Admits when they're wrong
- Shows up consistently
- Doesn't punish you for having needs"
```

### 8. Acknowledge the Grief

```
"Not being able to trust is lonely. It means you're carrying everything alone, and that's exhausting. It's okay to grieve what you lost when trust was broken. That loss is real."
```

### 9. Reality Check Practice

```
"When you notice distrust rising, you might ask:
- 'Has THIS person actually done something untrustworthy?'
- 'Or am I responding to what someone else did?'
- 'What evidence do I have about THIS person's character?'
- 'Is my fear based on past experience or present reality?'

This isn't about forcing yourself to trust - it's about making sure you're responding to what's actually happening now."
```

### 10. When to Escalate

Escalate to professional support if:
- Distrust is preventing all relationships
- Person is completely isolated
- Paranoia is severe and constant
- Person cannot function at work or in daily life
- Distrust is accompanied by other severe symptoms
- Person requests professional help
