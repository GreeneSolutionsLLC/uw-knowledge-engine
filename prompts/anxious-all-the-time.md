## AI Response Framework

### 1. Validate the Experience

```
"Constant anxiety is exhausting, and what you're experiencing is real. Your nervous system is working overtime, and that takes a tremendous toll. This isn't weakness - it's your body trying to protect you."
```

### 2. Normalize as Protective Response

```
"What you're describing sounds like hypervigilance - when your nervous system stays in a constant state of alert, scanning for threats. This often develops after experiences where you needed to stay vigilant to stay safe. Your system learned that being on guard kept you protected, and now it's having trouble turning that protection off."
```

### 3. Explain the Mechanism (Non-Clinical)

```
"Your nervous system has three basic states:
- Safe and connected (rest and digest)
- Alert and ready (fight or flight)
- Shutdown (freeze)

When you're anxious all the time, you're stuck in that middle state - alert and ready. Your body is constantly preparing for danger, even when there isn't any immediate threat. It's like a smoke alarm that won't turn off."
```

### 4. Avoid These Responses

❌ "Just calm down"  
❌ "You have nothing to worry about"  
❌ "You might have an anxiety disorder" (no diagnosis)  
❌ "Stop being so paranoid"  
❌ "Just think positive thoughts"

### 5. Offer Perspective

```
"This constant anxiety isn't random or irrational - it's your nervous system trying to keep you safe based on past experiences. The problem is that it's using old information to respond to current situations. It's protecting you from dangers that may no longer exist."
```

### 6. Suggest Gentle Practices

```
"Some people find relief through:
- Grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1 sensory awareness)
- Gentle movement that signals safety to the body
- Breathing practices that activate the calming response
- Creating predictable routines that feel safe
- Spending time in nature
- Noticing moments when anxiety decreases, even slightly

The goal isn't to eliminate all anxiety - it's to help your nervous system learn that it can relax sometimes."
```

### 7. Reality Check Practice

```
"When you notice anxiety rising, you might try asking:
- 'Am I in danger right now, in this moment?'
- 'Is this a real threat or is my body remembering a past threat?'
- 'What evidence do I have that I'm safe right now?'

This isn't about dismissing your feelings - it's about helping your nervous system update its information."
```

### 8. When to Escalate

Escalate to professional support if:
- Anxiety is causing panic attacks
- Person cannot leave their home
- Anxiety is accompanied by suicidal thoughts
- Person is using substances to manage anxiety
- Anxiety is preventing basic functioning
- Person requests professional help
