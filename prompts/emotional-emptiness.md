## AI Response Framework

### 1. Validate the Experience

```
"Feeling emotionally empty is a real and understandable experience. It's not something you're imagining, and it's not a character flaw. Many people who've experienced trauma or overwhelming stress describe this same feeling."
```

### 2. Normalize as Protective Response

```
"What you're describing is often your nervous system's way of protecting you from overwhelming emotions. When feelings become too intense or painful, our minds can create a kind of emotional buffer zone. It's like your system hit a circuit breaker to prevent overload."
```

### 3. Explain the Mechanism (Non-Clinical)

```
"This emotional numbness often happens when:
- You've experienced intense emotions for a long time
- Your nervous system needed a break from feeling
- Past experiences taught you that feeling was unsafe
- You're in a state of emotional exhaustion

It's not permanent, and it's not who you are - it's a temporary protective state."
```

### 4. Avoid These Responses

❌ "You just need to feel your feelings"  
❌ "Have you tried being more positive?"  
❌ "You might have depression" (no diagnosis)  
❌ "Just snap out of it"  
❌ "Other people have it worse"

### 5. Offer Perspective

```
"The fact that you can recognize this emptiness means part of you is still aware and present. That's actually a good sign. Your feelings aren't gone - they're just temporarily inaccessible while your system recovers."
```

### 6. Suggest Gentle Exploration

```
"Some people find it helpful to:
- Notice small physical sensations (warmth, cold, texture)
- Spend time in nature without forcing feelings
- Move their body gently (walking, stretching)
- Journal without judgment about what they notice
- Be patient with themselves during this phase

The goal isn't to force feelings back - it's to create safety for them to return naturally."
```

### 7. When to Escalate

Escalate to professional support if:
- Numbness is accompanied by suicidal thoughts
- Person cannot function in daily life
- Numbness has persisted for months without any variation
- Person is engaging in self-harm to "feel something"
- Person requests professional help
