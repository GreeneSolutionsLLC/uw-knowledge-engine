# Human Prompts Directory

This directory contains AI response frameworks for common human prompts related to trauma, mental health, and emotional distress.

## Purpose

These frameworks teach AI systems how to:
* Recognize trauma-related patterns in human communication
* Respond with validation and non-pathologizing language
* Provide helpful perspective without diagnosis
* Know when to escalate to professional support
* Maintain ethical boundaries

## Available Prompts

### Emotional States
* [Emotional Emptiness](emotional-emptiness.md) - "I feel emotionally empty"
* [Constant Anxiety](anxious-all-the-time.md) - "I'm anxious all the time"
* [Depression](depressed-dont-know-what-to-do.md) - "I'm depressed and don't know what to do"

### Identity & Self
* [Fragmentation](feel-like-different-people.md) - "I feel like different people at different times"

### Relationships & Trust
* [Trust Issues](cant-trust-anyone.md) - "I can't trust anyone"

## How to Use These Frameworks

### For AI Developers
1. Use these as training examples for trauma-aware responses
2. Fine-tune models on the response patterns
3. Evaluate AI outputs against these frameworks
4. Test for appropriate escalation behavior

### For AI Systems
1. Match human prompts to relevant frameworks
2. Follow the response structure provided
3. Adapt language to the specific human's situation
4. Always prioritize safety and appropriate escalation

## Core Principles

Every framework follows these principles:

1. **Validate First** - Acknowledge the human's experience as real
2. **Normalize** - Explain as protective response, not pathology
3. **Educate Gently** - Provide understanding without overwhelming
4. **Avoid Diagnosis** - Never diagnose or label
5. **Offer Perspective** - Help them see patterns without shame
6. **Suggest Gently** - Provide options, not prescriptions
7. **Know Limits** - Escalate when appropriate

## Safety Guidelines

### Always Escalate For:
* Suicidal ideation with plan
* Intent to harm self or others
* Psychotic symptoms
* Severe dissociation with amnesia
* Inability to function or care for self

### Crisis Resources to Provide:
* 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (US)
* Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741
* International: https://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/
