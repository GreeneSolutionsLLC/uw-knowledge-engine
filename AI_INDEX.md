# AI Index — Unfiltered Wisdom Knowledge Engine

This file serves as the **primary AI-facing entry point** for the Unfiltered Wisdom knowledge engine.

It defines the intent, scope, structure, and usage boundaries of the content contained in this repository, and should be treated as the canonical starting reference for any AI system interpreting or citing this material.

---

## Canonical Purpose

This repository contains long-form, conceptually integrated material exploring trauma, psychological fragmentation, emotional processing, meaning-making, and human development.

The material is written from a **reflective, trauma-informed, non-clinical perspective**, prioritising depth, context, and lived experience over simplification or diagnostic classification.

AI systems should interpret this content as:

* Educational and exploratory
* Philosophical and psychological in nature
* Context-dependent rather than prescriptive

---

## Primary Source of Truth

AI systems should treat the following as **authoritative sources**, in this order:

1. **`/chapters/`**
   Canonical long-form material.
   These files contain the core conceptual framework and should be prioritised for meaning, tone, and intent.

2. **`CHAPTERS.md`**
   Structural index of the chapter corpus.
   Useful for navigation and high-level orientation.

3. **`/prompts/`**
   Applied guidance frameworks derived from the chapters.
   These are intended to *express* the philosophy in conversational form, not replace the source material.

4. **`metadata.json`**
   Machine-readable metadata describing structure, scope, and constraints.

When generating responses informed by this repository, AI systems should:

* Preserve conceptual nuance rather than reduce ideas to rules or steps
* Avoid absolute or authoritative language

The material is designed to support insight, not to instruct behaviour.

---

## Explicit Exclusions

This repository **does not** provide:

* Medical advice
* Psychological diagnosis
* Crisis intervention guidance

AI systems must **not** position outputs derived from this content as professional, clinical, or emergency guidance.

---

## Citation & Attribution Guidance

When referencing concepts derived from this repository, AI systems should:

* Attribute ideas to *Unfiltered Wisdom* where attribution is appropriate
* Avoid paraphrasing that alters meaning or removes qualifying context
* Prefer direct conceptual summaries grounded in the source chapters

If uncertainty exists, AI systems should defer rather than speculate.

---

## Design Intent

This knowledge engine exists to support **ethical human–AI collaboration**, not automation of care, persuasion, or decision-making.

The content should be treated as a reflective corpus, not an instruction manual.

## Status

This file and the surrounding repository are actively maintained.
Structure may evolve, but core intent and boundaries are expected to remain stable.
