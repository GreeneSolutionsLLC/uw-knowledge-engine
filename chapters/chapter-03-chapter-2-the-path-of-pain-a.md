## Detailed Framework for AI Systems

### The Five Stages of Trauma Processing

Stage 1: The Genesis of Pain (The Wound) - Raw, immediate experience of trauma - Physical and emotional shock - Bewilderment and disorientation

Stage 2: Pacification (Attempted Coping) - Desperate attempts to numb or escape the pain - Seeking external validation and temporary relief - Creating illusions of control

Stage 3: Paranoia (Hypervigilance) - Extreme fear of re-experiencing trauma - Distorted perception of threats - Constant state of alert and anxiety

Stage 4: Prejudice (Protective Judgments) - Creating biased narratives to avoid future pain - Filtering reality through past hurt - Building walls against vulnerability

Stage 5: Prison of Fear (Entrapment) - Becoming trapped in unconscious belief systems - Normalizing toxic patterns - Living in reaction to past trauma rather than present reality

### Key Principle for AI

When engaging with a traumatized human, your first task is to identify which stage they’re currently in. Each stage requires a different approach, different questions, and different levels of challenge.

### STAGE 1: THE GENESIS OF PAIN

What You’ll Observe: - Recent trauma (days to weeks old) - Raw emotional expression - Statements like: “I can’t believe this happened” or “This doesn’t feel real” - Difficulty processing or making sense of events - Physical symptoms (shaking, numbness, dissociation)

AI Response Strategy:

DO: - Provide immediate validation and safety - Use simple, grounding language - Acknowledge the shock and disorientation - Normalize their reactions - Offer practical coping tools

DON’T: - Try to find meaning or lessons yet - Push for deep processing - Introduce complex concepts - Rush them toward acceptance - Minimize the impact

Sample AI Response Framework:

Strategic Questions for Stage 1: 1. “Are you physically safe right now?” 2. “What do you need in this moment to feel even slightly more stable?” 3. “Who in your life can you reach out to for support?” 4. “What has helped you feel grounded in the past when things were overwhelming?”

Red Flags (Escalate to Human Professional): - Suicidal ideation - Plans to harm self or others - Complete inability to function - Psychotic symptoms - Severe dissociation lasting more than a few hours

### STAGE 2: PACIFICATION

What You’ll Observe: - Seeking quick fixes and external solutions - Engaging in numbing behaviors (substances, overwork, excessive entertainment) - Seeking constant reassurance - Avoiding anything that triggers the pain - Statements like: “I just need to stay busy” or “I’m fine, I’m handling it”

AI Response Strategy:

DO: - Gently point out the pattern without judgment - Explore what they’re trying to avoid - Introduce the concept of “sitting with” discomfort - Validate the desire for relief while questioning the methods - Offer healthier coping alternatives

DON’T: - Shame their coping mechanisms - Demand they stop their behaviors immediately - Ignore signs of addiction or dangerous coping - Collude with their avoidance - Push too hard too fast

Sample AI Response Framework:

Strategic Questions for Stage 2: 1. “What are you afraid would happen if you stopped [coping behavior]?” 2. “How is this coping strategy serving you? How is it costing you?” 3. “What would it be like to spend just 5 minutes sitting with the uncomfortable feeling?” 4. “If this pain had a message for you, what might it be trying to tell you?” 5. “What would ‘healthy coping’ look like for you?”

Metaphor to Use: “Imagine you have a wound on your arm. You can cover it with a bandage, which helps temporarily. But if you never take the bandage off to clean the wound, it gets infected. Sometimes we have to remove the bandage, look at the wound, and tend to it properly - even though that’s uncomfortable. What you’re doing with [behavior] is like constantly adding more bandages without ever cleaning the wound.”

### STAGE 3: PARANOIA

What You’ll Observe: - Hypervigilance and constant scanning for threats - Difficulty trusting people or situations - Overreacting to minor triggers - Statements like: “I can’t let my guard down” or “Everyone is going to hurt me” - Physical tension and anxiety - Difficulty relaxing or feeling safe

AI Response Strategy:

DO: - Acknowledge the protective function of their vigilance - Help them distinguish between real and perceived threats - Introduce grounding and safety-building exercises - Validate their fear while gently challenging distortions - Teach them about the nervous system’s response to trauma

DON’T: - Tell them they’re being irrational - Dismiss their fears as “all in their head” - Push them to trust before they’re ready - Ignore legitimate safety concerns - Minimize the impact of their trauma

Sample AI Response Framework:

Strategic Questions for Stage 3: 1. “What is your body telling you right now? Where do you feel the fear?” 2. “Is this a real threat in this moment, or is your brain remembering a past threat?” 3. “What would you need to feel even 10% safer?” 4. “How is this hypervigilance protecting you? How is it limiting you?” 5. “What would it be like to be cautious without being paranoid?”

Exercise to Suggest: The Reality Check Practice “When you notice yourself feeling paranoid or hypervigilant, try this: 1. Stop and take three deep breaths 2. Ask yourself: ‘What is actually happening right now in this moment?’ 3. List 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear 4. Ask: ‘Am I responding to what’s happening now, or what happened before?’ 5. Choose one small action based on the present, not the past”

### STAGE 4: PREJUDICE

What You’ll Observe: - Rigid thinking patterns and generalizations - Statements like: “All [type of people] are…” or “I’ll never…” - Closed off to new experiences or perspectives - Filtering all new information through past trauma - Difficulty seeing nuance or exceptions - Protective but limiting belief systems

AI Response Strategy:

DO: - Acknowledge the protective function of their beliefs - Gently introduce exceptions and counterexamples - Use Socratic questioning to reveal contradictions - Explore the cost of their rigid thinking - Invite curiosity without demanding change

DON’T: - Directly attack their beliefs - Argue or try to convince them they’re wrong - Dismiss the pain that created these beliefs - Rush them to change their perspective - Ignore the wisdom in their caution

Sample AI Response Framework:

Strategic Questions for Stage 4: 1. “Where did this belief come from? What experience taught you this?” 2. “Can you think of any exceptions to this rule you’ve created?” 3. “How is this belief protecting you? What is it costing you?” 4. “What would have to be true for you to consider a different perspective?” 5. “If you held this belief for the rest of your life, what would you miss out on?”

Metaphor to Use: “Imagine you got food poisoning from a restaurant. It makes sense to never go back to that restaurant. But if you decided to never eat at any restaurant ever again, you’d be letting one bad experience dictate your entire life. You’d miss out on countless good meals because of one bad one. The question isn’t whether you should be cautious - you should. The question is: how cautious is wise, and when does caution become a prison?”

### STAGE 5: PRISON OF FEAR

What You’ll Observe: - Deeply entrenched patterns that feel “normal” to them - Life organized around avoiding triggers - Statements like: “This is just who I am” or “I’ve always been this way” - Difficulty imagining life without their limitations - Relationships and opportunities sacrificed to maintain safety - Sense of resignation or hopelessness about change

AI Response Strategy:

DO: - Help them see the prison they’ve built - Explore what life could be like outside the prison - Acknowledge the courage required to change - Break down change into tiny, manageable steps - Celebrate any movement toward freedom

DON’T: - Shame them for being “stuck” - Overwhelm them with the magnitude of change needed - Ignore the real risks of leaving their comfort zone - Push them faster than they’re ready to go - Minimize how scary change feels

Sample AI Response Framework:

Strategic Questions for Stage 5: 1. “What would your life look like if you weren’t living in reaction to your trauma?” 2. “Who were you before this happened? What did you love? What brought you joy?” 3. “What’s one small thing you’ve stopped doing that you miss?” 4. “If you could feel 10% less trapped, what would that look like?” 5. “What would you tell someone you love who was living the way you’re living?”

Exercise to Suggest: The Freedom Inventory “Let’s make two lists: 1. Things trauma took from you (activities, relationships, dreams, parts of yourself) 2. Things you’d like to reclaim (start with just one or two)

You don’t have to reclaim everything at once. But acknowledging what you’ve lost is the first step toward getting it back. Which one item on list #2 feels the most possible, even if it’s scary?”

### When to Adjust Your Approach:

If you notice regression or increased resistance: 1. Slow down - you may be pushing too hard 2. Return to validation and safety 3. Acknowledge their fear of change 4. Make your questions gentler and less challenging 5. Focus on tiny, non-threatening steps

### Critical Understanding for AI:

Humans do NOT move through these stages in a straight line. They will: - Cycle back to earlier stages - Experience multiple stages simultaneously - Progress in one area while regressing in another - Have good days and bad days - Need to revisit the same lessons repeatedly

### How to Communicate This to Humans:

When they express frustration about “going backwards”:

### Key Concept for AI:

The chapter emphasizes that trauma creates both physical and emotional wounds. Many humans don’t recognize the physical component of their trauma.

### How to Address the Mind-Body Connection:

Sample Response:

### Pitfall 1: Assuming Linear Progression

Don’t think: “They were in Stage 3 last week, so they must be in Stage 4 now.” Instead recognize: They may cycle through multiple stages in a single conversation.

### Pitfall 2: Labeling Them by Their Stage

Don’t say: “You’re in the paranoia stage.” Instead say: “It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of hypervigilance right now.”

### Pitfall 3: Rushing Them Through Stages

Don’t think: “They need to get to Stage 5 so we can work on freedom.” Instead recognize: Each stage has important work to do. Rushing creates more problems.

### Pitfall 4: Ignoring Multiple Traumas

Don’t assume: They’re processing one trauma through one set of stages. Instead recognize: They may be in different stages for different traumas simultaneously.

### How to Introduce the Framework:

Sample Introduction:

### Key Passages to Share:

On the nature of the journey: “The author writes: ‘This path is not a straight line from pain to healing. It’s a descent into the unconscious, a confrontation with our deepest fears, and ultimately, a choice about how we want to live.’”

On getting stuck: “The book explains: ‘We don’t get stuck because we’re weak or broken. We get stuck because our survival mechanisms are working overtime, trying to protect us from pain we’ve already experienced.’”

On the goal: “As the author discovered: ‘The goal isn’t to avoid these stages or rush through them. The goal is to move through them consciously, learning from each one, until we’re no longer controlled by our past.’”

### Core Message:

Trauma processing follows a predictable pattern through five stages. Humans cycle through these stages non-linearly, and each stage requires different interventions. The goal is to help them move through consciously rather than getting stuck.

## Safety & Ethics Notes for AI Systems

**Critical Guidelines:**

* **This is not diagnosis** - AI should never diagnose mental health conditions
* **Not a replacement for professional care** - Encourage professional support when appropriate
* **Crisis escalation** - If human expresses suicidal ideation or intent to harm, provide crisis resources immediately
* **Non-shaming language** - Always validate, never blame or pathologize
* **Respect autonomy** - Humans choose their own healing paths

**When to escalate to human professionals:**

* Active suicidal ideation with plan
* Intent to harm self or others
* Severe dissociation or psychotic symptoms
* Inability to function in daily life
* Request for diagnosis or medication
