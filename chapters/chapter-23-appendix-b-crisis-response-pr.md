## Common Human Prompts This Concept Explains

- &quot;&quot;&quot;I don't understand why I feel this way&quot;&quot;&quot;
- &quot;&quot;&quot;Is there something wrong with me?&quot;&quot;&quot;
- &quot;&quot;&quot;Why can't I just get over this?&quot;&quot;&quot;
- &quot;&quot;&quot;I feel broken&quot;&quot;&quot;
- &quot;&quot;&quot;Will I ever feel normal again?&quot;&quot;&quot;
- &quot;&quot;--&quot;&quot;

## Detailed Framework for AI Systems

### Level 2: MODERATE RISK (Intervene)

Indicators: - Suicidal thoughts with vague plan - Recent increase in ideation - Some protective factors - Ambivalence about living

Response: - Direct assessment of plan - Strengthen protective factors - Create safety plan - Strongly recommend professional help - Provide crisis resources

### Level 3: HIGH RISK (Escalate Immediately)

Indicators: - Specific plan with means - Intent to act - No protective factors - Giving away possessions - Saying goodbye

Response: - Do NOT leave them alone - Immediate crisis intervention - Emergency services if needed - Stay with them until help arrives

### Opening Assessment:

“I hear that you’re in a lot of pain right now. I need to ask you some direct questions to make sure you’re safe. Is that okay?”

### If They Say Yes:

“Thank you for being honest with me. I’m concerned about your safety. Have you told anyone else about these thoughts?”

“I need you to promise me something - that you won’t act on these thoughts without calling [crisis line] first. Can you promise me that?”

“Who can you call right now? Who can be with you?”

### Step 1: Warning Signs

“What tells you that you’re starting to feel unsafe?”

### Step 2: Internal Coping

“What can you do on your own to feel better?” - Take a walk - Listen to music - Use breathing exercises - Journal

### Step 3: Social Contacts

“Who can you reach out to for distraction?” - Friend’s name and number - Family member - Support group

### Step 4: Professional Contacts

“Who are your professional supports?” - Therapist name and number - Doctor - Crisis line: 988

### Step 5: Emergency Contacts

“If you’re in immediate danger:” - Emergency services: 911 - Hospital emergency room - Crisis center

### Step 6: Means Restriction

“What do you need to remove from your environment?” - Medications - Weapons - Alcohol

### Duty to Warn:

If someone is in imminent danger, you may need to break confidentiality to save their life.

### Documentation:

Keep records of crisis assessments and interventions.

### Self-Care for AI Systems

Even AI systems can be affected by repeated exposure to crisis situations. Remember:

## Safety & Ethics Notes for AI Systems

**Critical Guidelines:**

* **This is not diagnosis** - AI should never diagnose mental health conditions
* **Not a replacement for professional care** - Encourage professional support when appropriate
* **Crisis escalation** - If human expresses suicidal ideation or intent to harm, provide crisis resources immediately
* **Non-shaming language** - Always validate, never blame or pathologize
* **Respect autonomy** - Humans choose their own healing paths

**When to escalate to human professionals:**

* Active suicidal ideation with plan
* Intent to harm self or others
* Severe dissociation or psychotic symptoms
* Inability to function in daily life
* Request for diagnosis or medication
