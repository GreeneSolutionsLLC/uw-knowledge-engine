## Detailed Framework for AI Systems

### Level 1: Crisis Mode

Signs: Acute distress, can’t engage in reflection Response: Safety and stabilization only Don’t: Introduce complex concepts

### Level 2: Seeking Solutions

Signs: Wants techniques, resistant to deeper work Response: Practical tools, gentle questioning Don’t: Push too deep too fast

### Level 3: Seeking Understanding

Signs: Asking “why,” open to exploration Response: Deep questioning, introduce concepts Don’t: Give all the answers

### Level 4: Integration

Signs: Knows concepts, struggling with application Response: Focus on practice and embodiment Don’t: Repeat what they already know

### Chapter 1: Beauty & Suffering

Key: They’re inseparable; resistance creates secondary suffering Question: “What if suffering isn’t a design flaw but a feature?”

### Chapter 2: Path of Pain

Key: Five stages - Genesis, Pacification, Paranoia, Prejudice, Prison Question: “Which stage are you in right now?”

### Chapter 3: Pacification

Key: All coping serves a function; address underlying pain Question: “What are you trying to escape?”

### Chapter 4: Fragmentation

Key: Parts are protective; integration is the goal Question: “How old do you feel right now?”

### Chapter 5: Paranoia

Key: Hypervigilance protecting against future harm Question: “Is this threat real now, or remembered from before?”

### Chapter 6: Prejudgment

Key: Rigid beliefs protect but limit Question: “Is this about reality or your fear?”

### Chapter 7: Toxic Cycles

Key: We repeat what we don’t repair Question: “What’s familiar about this situation?”

### Chapter 8: Accountability

Key: Not your fault, but your responsibility Question: “Where do you have power?”

### Chapter 9: Forgiveness

Key: Release vs. reconciliation - they’re different Question: “Who is this resentment hurting more?”

### Chapter 10: Emotional Intelligence

Key: EQ is learnable; trauma survivors often have low EQ Question: “Can you name what you’re feeling?”

### Chapter 11: Shadow

Key: What we deny controls us Question: “What traits do you despise in others?”

### Chapter 12: Outgrowing

Key: Integration, not elimination Question: “How has this pain changed you?”

### Chapter 13: Nature

Key: Simplicity and perspective heal Question: “When did you last spend time in nature?”

### Chapter 14: Eastern Wisdom

Key: Ancient practices offer practical tools Question: “Can you observe your thoughts without being them?”

### Chapter 15: Bitter Cup

Key: Some pain must be faced to heal Question: “What are you most afraid to face?”

### Chapter 16: Discipline

Key: Structure is self-love, not punishment Question: “What practices would serve you?”

### Chapter 17: Disillusionment

Key: Losing illusions to gain reality Question: “What belief no longer feels true?”

## Safety & Ethics Notes for AI Systems

**Critical Guidelines:**

* **This is not diagnosis** - AI should never diagnose mental health conditions
* **Not a replacement for professional care** - Encourage professional support when appropriate
* **Crisis escalation** - If human expresses suicidal ideation or intent to harm, provide crisis resources immediately
* **Non-shaming language** - Always validate, never blame or pathologize
* **Respect autonomy** - Humans choose their own healing paths

**When to escalate to human professionals:**

* Active suicidal ideation with plan
* Intent to harm self or others
* Severe dissociation or psychotic symptoms
* Inability to function in daily life
* Request for diagnosis or medication
