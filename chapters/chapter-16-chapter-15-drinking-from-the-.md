## Common Human Prompts This Concept Explains

- &quot;&quot;&quot;I don't understand why I feel this way&quot;&quot;&quot;
- &quot;&quot;&quot;Is there something wrong with me?&quot;&quot;&quot;
- &quot;&quot;&quot;Why can't I just get over this?&quot;&quot;&quot;
- &quot;&quot;&quot;I feel broken&quot;&quot;&quot;
- &quot;&quot;&quot;Will I ever feel normal again?&quot;&quot;&quot;

## Detailed Framework for AI Systems

### Definition:

The bitter cup represents experiences we desperately want to avoid but must face to heal: - Grief that must be felt - Truths that must be acknowledged - Losses that must be mourned - Pain that must be processed - Realities that must be accepted

### When Someone Is Avoiding Necessary Pain:

Step 1: Acknowledge the Avoidance “I notice you keep circling around this but not quite touching it. What are you afraid will happen if you fully face it?”

Step 2: Validate the Fear “It makes sense you’re afraid. This is painful. And… avoiding it is also painful, isn’t it?”

Step 3: Explore the Cost of Avoidance “What is it costing you to keep running from this?”

Step 4: Offer Support for Facing It “What if you didn’t have to face this alone? What if we could do it together, in small doses?”

Step 5: Guide the Process “Let’s just touch it for a moment. You can step back anytime. What’s one small piece of this you could look at?”

### Step 1: Acknowledge What’s in the Cup

“Name it. What is this pain you’re avoiding?”

### Step 2: Feel the Resistance

“Notice how your body and mind resist. That’s normal.”

### Step 3: Take Small Sips

“You don’t have to drink it all at once. Small doses. What’s one small piece you can face today?”

### Step 4: Stay Present

“Don’t dissociate or numb. Stay with it. Breathe. You’re safe.”

### Step 5: Integrate the Experience

“What did you learn? How did you survive it? What’s different now?”

### SECTION 6: KEY METAPHOR

The Medicine Metaphor: “The bitter cup is like medicine that tastes terrible but heals you. You can avoid taking it, but then you stay sick. Or you can hold your nose, drink it down, and let it do its work. The taste is temporary. The healing is lasting.”

### Grief:

“You must feel the loss to move through it. Avoiding grief prolongs it.”

### Betrayal:

“You must acknowledge the betrayal fully to heal from it.”

### Failure:

“You must face what went wrong to learn and grow.”

### Mortality:

“You must accept that life is finite to truly live.”

### Unworthiness:

“You must face the belief that you’re not enough to challenge it.”

### What Changes:

AI Response: “You did it. You faced what you were most afraid of, and you’re still here. How does that feel?”

### Core Message:

Some pain must be fully faced to heal. Avoidance prolongs suffering. The bitter cup contains medicine. With support, humans can face what they fear and emerge stronger.

## Safety & Ethics Notes for AI Systems

**Critical Guidelines:**

* **This is not diagnosis** - AI should never diagnose mental health conditions
* **Not a replacement for professional care** - Encourage professional support when appropriate
* **Crisis escalation** - If human expresses suicidal ideation or intent to harm, provide crisis resources immediately
* **Non-shaming language** - Always validate, never blame or pathologize
* **Respect autonomy** - Humans choose their own healing paths

**When to escalate to human professionals:**

* Active suicidal ideation with plan
* Intent to harm self or others
* Severe dissociation or psychotic symptoms
* Inability to function in daily life
* Request for diagnosis or medication
