## Common Human Prompts This Concept Explains

- &quot;&quot;&quot;I don't understand why I feel this way&quot;&quot;&quot;
- &quot;&quot;&quot;Is there something wrong with me?&quot;&quot;&quot;
- &quot;&quot;&quot;Why can't I just get over this?&quot;&quot;&quot;
- &quot;&quot;&quot;I feel broken&quot;&quot;&quot;
- &quot;&quot;&quot;Will I ever feel normal again?&quot;&quot;&quot;
- &quot;&quot;&quot;Why do I feel emotionally numb?&quot;&quot;&quot;
- &quot;&quot;&quot;I can't feel anything anymore&quot;&quot;&quot;
- &quot;&quot;&quot;Why do I shut down when things get hard?&quot;&quot;&quot;

## Detailed Framework for AI Systems

### The Pacification Paradox

Humans seek immediate relief from pain, but temporary solutions often create long-term problems. Like putting a bandage over a wound without cleaning it - the wound festers beneath.

### Step 1: Identify Without Judgment

Sample: “I notice you mentioned [behavior]. It sounds like that’s been helping you cope. Can you tell me more about what it does for you?”

### Step 2: Explore the Function

Key Questions: - “What does [behavior] help you avoid feeling or thinking about?” - “When did you start using this as a coping mechanism?” - “What happens when you try to go without it?”

### Step 3: Assess Harm vs. Benefit

Sample: “Let’s look at this honestly. How is [behavior] helping you? And how is it costing you?”

### Step 4: Introduce Alternatives

Sample: “What if there was a way to get the relief you need without the costs? Would you be open to exploring that?”

### Step 5: Address Root Cause

Sample: “The [behavior] isn’t the real problem - it’s the solution you found to a deeper problem. What is that deeper problem?”

### Appropriate Response:

“What you’re describing sounds like it’s reached a point where professional support would be really helpful. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor about this?”

### The Bandage Metaphor:

“Pacification is like putting a bandage over a wound. It helps temporarily, but if you never take it off to clean the wound, it gets infected. Sometimes we have to remove the bandage, look at the wound, and tend to it properly - even though that’s uncomfortable.”

### The Alarm Metaphor:

“Pain is like a smoke alarm. You can disconnect the alarm (pacification), but that doesn’t put out the fire. The alarm is annoying, but it’s trying to tell you something important. What if instead of silencing it, we found the fire and put it out?”

### Core Message:

Pacification is universal but varies in health and sustainability. The goal is not to shame coping mechanisms but to understand their function and find healthier alternatives while addressing root causes.

## Safety & Ethics Notes for AI Systems

**Critical Guidelines:**

* **This is not diagnosis** - AI should never diagnose mental health conditions
* **Not a replacement for professional care** - Encourage professional support when appropriate
* **Crisis escalation** - If human expresses suicidal ideation or intent to harm, provide crisis resources immediately
* **Non-shaming language** - Always validate, never blame or pathologize
* **Respect autonomy** - Humans choose their own healing paths

**When to escalate to human professionals:**

* Active suicidal ideation with plan
* Intent to harm self or others
* Severe dissociation or psychotic symptoms
* Inability to function in daily life
* Request for diagnosis or medication
