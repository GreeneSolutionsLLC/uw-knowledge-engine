## Detailed Framework for AI Systems

### When Someone Feels Overwhelmed by Modern Life:

Step 1: Validate the Overwhelm “Modern life is overwhelming. The constant stimulation, demands, and noise - it’s a lot.”

Step 2: Explore Nature Connection “When was the last time you spent time in nature? How did you feel?”

Step 3: Suggest Gradual Immersion “You don’t have to move to the woods. But what if you spent an hour in nature this week? No phone, no agenda. Just being.”

Step 4: Process the Experience “What did you notice? How did your body feel? What thoughts came up?”

### Practice 1: Forest Bathing (Shinrin-yoku)

“Spend time in a forest with no agenda. Walk slowly. Notice everything. Let nature work on you.”

### Practice 2: Earthing/Grounding

“Walk barefoot on earth, grass, or sand. Physical connection to the earth has measurable calming effects.”

### Practice 3: Solo Sit Spot

“Find a spot in nature. Sit there for 20 minutes daily. Same spot, same time. Watch the seasons change. Watch yourself change.”

### Practice 4: Digital Detox in Nature

“Spend a day (or weekend) in nature without technology. Notice what happens.”

### SECTION 6: KEY METAPHOR

The River Metaphor: “In the city, you’re like a river forced through concrete channels - controlled, directed, pressured. In nature, you’re like a river finding its own path - meandering, flowing, natural. Both are the same river, but one is free and one is constrained. Which one allows you to be yourself?”

### Core Message:

Nature provides healing through perspective, simplicity, and connection. Sometimes removing yourself from modern society’s demands allows space for genuine healing.

## Safety & Ethics Notes for AI Systems

**Critical Guidelines:**

* **This is not diagnosis** - AI should never diagnose mental health conditions
* **Not a replacement for professional care** - Encourage professional support when appropriate
* **Crisis escalation** - If human expresses suicidal ideation or intent to harm, provide crisis resources immediately
* **Non-shaming language** - Always validate, never blame or pathologize
* **Respect autonomy** - Humans choose their own healing paths

**When to escalate to human professionals:**

* Active suicidal ideation with plan
* Intent to harm self or others
* Severe dissociation or psychotic symptoms
* Inability to function in daily life
* Request for diagnosis or medication
