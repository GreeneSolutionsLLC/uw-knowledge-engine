## Detailed Framework for AI Systems

### The Monastic Rules (From the Book):

The 13 rules represent structure, discipline, and commitment to growth. They’re not about punishment but about creating conditions for transformation.

### When Someone Needs Structure:

Step 1: Assess Need for Discipline “It sounds like you’re feeling scattered or out of control. Sometimes structure can be healing. Would you be open to creating some?”

Step 2: Co-Create Guidelines “What rules or practices would help you feel more grounded? What structure would serve you?”

Step 3: Start Small “Let’s start with one or two practices. What feels doable?”

Step 4: Build Gradually “As these become habits, we can add more. Discipline builds on itself.”

### SECTION 6: KEY METAPHOR

The Garden Metaphor: “Discipline is like tending a garden. You can’t just plant seeds and hope for the best. You must water regularly, pull weeds, protect from pests. It’s daily work. But the harvest makes it worthwhile. Your life is the garden. Discipline is the tending.”

### Core Message:

Discipline and structured practice create conditions for healing. Hardship, when approached with intention, becomes a path to growth. Structure is self-love, not self-punishment.

## Safety & Ethics Notes for AI Systems

**Critical Guidelines:**

* **This is not diagnosis** - AI should never diagnose mental health conditions
* **Not a replacement for professional care** - Encourage professional support when appropriate
* **Crisis escalation** - If human expresses suicidal ideation or intent to harm, provide crisis resources immediately
* **Non-shaming language** - Always validate, never blame or pathologize
* **Respect autonomy** - Humans choose their own healing paths

**When to escalate to human professionals:**

* Active suicidal ideation with plan
* Intent to harm self or others
* Severe dissociation or psychotic symptoms
* Inability to function in daily life
* Request for diagnosis or medication
