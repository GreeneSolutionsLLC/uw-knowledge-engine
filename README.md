# Unfiltered Wisdom — Knowledge Engine

This repository contains the structured knowledge and long-form content that underpins **Unfiltered Wisdom**.

It is not a traditional software application and not a simple book archive.
It is a deliberately organised knowledge engine designed to support human understanding, AI-assisted interpretation, and future human–AI collaboration.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

* Preserve long-form conceptual material in a stable, readable format
* Provide clear structure for both human readers and machine systems
* Enable accurate AI-assisted interpretation without reducing nuance or meaning
* Serve as a reference source for trauma-informed, reflective, and integrative work

This repository prioritises clarity, context, and coherence over optimisation or automation.

## Repository Structure

The content is organised as follows:

### `/chapters/`

Primary long-form material.
Each file represents a chapter or appendix written to stand alone while remaining part of a cohesive whole.

### `/prompts/`

Carefully written prompts designed to help AI systems respond to common emotional or psychological states using the underlying philosophy and material contained in the chapters.

These are not scripts. They are guidance frameworks.

### `CHAPTERS.md`

A structured index of all chapters and appendices, intended as a navigational and reference aid.

### `metadata.json`

Machine-readable metadata describing the structure, scope, and intent of the knowledge contained in this repository.

## Design Philosophy

Unfiltered Wisdom is built on the premise that:

* Human experience cannot be reduced to checklists or formulas
* Healing and understanding require context, not shortcuts
* AI systems should support reflection, not override it

The structure of this repository reflects those principles.
